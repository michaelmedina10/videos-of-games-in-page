# videos-of-games-in-page

This site was my first one and de main objective was to learn how to manipulate divs.
So, to make the page more interesting, i added images of my videos on the youtube, all positioned at the center of the screen, to be more exactly, the page has a square div
and this div is splited in two lines each line has two smaller squares.

When the user click on the image, he is directed to other page where the video is.
